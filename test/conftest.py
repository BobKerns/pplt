'''
Test harnesses (fixtures) for the project.

These are used to set up the environment for the tests. They are defined with the `@pytest.fixture` decorator
and can be used in test functions by passing them as arguments. If defined as a generator that yields once,
they act similar to how a context manager works, running the code after the `yield` after the test function
completes, whether successfully or not.

# None yet, but this is where they need to go.
